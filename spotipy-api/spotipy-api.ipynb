       "  'description': '<br/>    <p>On this episode of FYI, we explore the strategic launch of Meta’s Threads and their significant impact on brands with a keen focus on brand safety. We discuss how large brands tend to be risk-averse and how Twitter’s brand safety issues have made Meta’s Threads appealing for advertisers. We also explore the rise of TikTok as a platform for performance advertising, along with the advantages of Meta’s algorithm for performance advertising. We touch on the success and challenges of brand characters and the importance of authenticity in content. Additionally, we delve into the significance of organic content on TikTok before running ads, the role of social proof, and the rise of retail media and over-the-top (OTT) advertising. We analyze the impact of Threads on brand safety perceptions and the differing perspectives on Threads and Twitter. We also explore the recent announcements of creator funds by Snap and Meta and their implications. We delve into VaynerMedia’s role in digital advertising and their integrated creative and media approach. Finally, we discuss the excitement surrounding Roku’s partnership with Shopify in TV-generated commerce and the potential for targeted advertising based on collected data. Join us as we explore these timely and relevant topics with our guest, Jon Morgenstern.</p><br/>    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text&#61;%22It&#43;was&#43;strategic&#43;and&#43;very&#43;smart&#43;timing%2C&#43;at&#43;least&#43;in&#43;the&#43;perspective&#43;of&#43;brands%2C&#43;for&#43;Meta&#43;to&#43;launch&#43;threads&#43;when&#43;they&#43;did.%E2%80%9D&#43;%40JonMorgenstern%20&#64;ARKinvest%20-%20https://ark-invest.com/podcast/meta-threads-a-deep-dive-with-jon-morgenstern/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br/>        “It was strategic and very smart timing, at least in the perspective of brands, for Meta to launch threads when they did.” &#64;JonMorgenstern    </a><br/>    <h3>Key Points From This Episode:</h3><br/><ul><li>Gary Vaynerchuk and VaynerMedia loves being early in social media</li><li>Smart timing for Meta’s launch of threads.
